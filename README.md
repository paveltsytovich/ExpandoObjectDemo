# ExpandoObjectDemo
Practical case for use ExpandoObject and dynamic type

- Practice challenge â€“ load and useful access to CSV file
- Look firstly unit tests and infrastucture for support compare dynamic instance type:
  - We are writing unit tests. How to compare two dynamic instances?
  - We are implementing load CSV file by LumerWorksCsvReader package and by DataTable
  - How can we map from a DataTable instance to a dynamic instance? Use ExpandoObject!
- Look secondly code implementation
